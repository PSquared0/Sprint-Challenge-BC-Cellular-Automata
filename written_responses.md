1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

A block first needs proof of work. This is created by solving a complex mathematical problem that is unique to each block of transactions. since each block has a different mathematical problem, every miner will work on a different problem unique to the block they built. for a block to be accepted by the network it needs to contain only valid transactions: inputs that are not yet spent, inputs that have the valid amount, proof of work,etc.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

The transaction is bundled into a block, then verify whether the transaction is valid.
Select the header of the most recent block and insert it into the new block as a â€œhash.", solve the mathematical problem and the solution is found,the new block is added to the block chain and then propagated throughout the network.


3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be 

It can be used for population modeling or traffic simulations.
